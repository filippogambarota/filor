\title{Create a YAML-style list from a named vector or list}
\usage{
create_yml(x, file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A named vector or list. The names will be used as keys, and
the corresponding values as values. `NA` values are converted to
empty strings.}

\item{file}{Optional. A character string giving the path to a file where
the YAML output should be written. If `NULL` (default), the result
is returned instead of written.}
}
\value{
If `file` is `NULL`, returns a character vector with one entry
  per YAML item. If `file` is not `NULL`, the YAML output is written
  to the specified file and the result is returned invisibly.
}
\description{
This function takes a named vector or list and converts it into a
YAML-style list of keyâ€“value pairs. Each element is represented as
`- key: value`. If a file path is provided, the YAML output is written
to disk.
}
\examples{
# Create a simple YAML list from a named vector
x <- c(name = "Alice", age = 30, country = NA)
create_yml(x)
