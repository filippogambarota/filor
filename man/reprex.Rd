\usage{
reprex(expr, comment = "#>")
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{An R expression or block of expressions surrounded by `{}`.
The expressions are deparsed and evaluated sequentially.}

\item{comment}{A string used to prefix each output line. Defaults to `"#>"`.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns `NULL`. The side effects are printed and copied text.
}
\description{
This helper function prints both the expression and its evaluated output
in a tidyverse-style format, prefixing output lines with a comment marker
(e.g. `#>`). The formatted text is also copied to the clipboard for easy
pasting into issues, documents, or chat.
}
\details{
- Leading indentation is stripped for readability.
- The outer `{}` of a block are removed before printing.
- Vector output markers like `[1]` are removed.
- The result (both code and output) is copied to the clipboard
  using the **clipr** package if available.
